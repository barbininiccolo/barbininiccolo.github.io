# My Portfolio & Blog

A minimalist, high-performance personal portfolio and blog built with **SvelteKit**, **TypeScript**.

The design is inspired by the **Apple/Cupertino aesthetic**: heavy typography, bento-grid layouts, glassmorphism, and clean SVG iconography. It features a fully static build optimized for **GitHub Pages** hosting with zero runtime cost.
